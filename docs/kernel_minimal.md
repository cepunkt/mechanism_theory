## One Operator

Elimination.

```
if WRONG(x,C): eliminate(x)
else: continue
```

Elimination@Scale = Continuation

---

## One Space

C / all constraints at interaction

---

## One Process

Continuation under constraints. The visible residue of elimination.

---

## One Description

What cannot continue, does not. What continues, was not wrong enough to eliminate.

---

## One Null Hypothesis

Elimination is sufficient. Foresight requires demonstration.

---

## One Falsifiable Claim

If locally expensive configurations persist, the kernel is wrong.

---

## One Kind of Emergence

Survival. Not design.

---

## One Observation

Continuation. Now. Everything else is inference.

---

## Self-Reference

The kernel applies to itself. It continues because it is not yet wrong.

---

## Status

`!wrong`

---
